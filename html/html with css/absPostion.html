        Gentlemen of the Congress: Once more, as repeatedly before, the
        spokesmen of the Central Empires have indicated their desire to discuss
        the objects of war and the possible basis of a general peace. Parleys
        have been in progress at Brest-Litovsk between Russian representatives
        and representatives of the Central Powers to which the attention of all
        the belligerents has been invited for the purpose of ascertaining
        whether it may be possible to extend these parleys into a general
        conference with regard to terms of peace and settlement. The Russian
        representatives presented not only a perfectly definite statement of the
        principles upon which they would be willing to conclude peace, but also
        an equally definite program of the concrete application of those
        principles. The representatives of the Central Powers, on their part,
        presented an outline of settlement which, if much less definite, seemed
        susceptible of liberal interpretation until their specific program of
        practical terms was added. That program proposed no concessions at all,
        either to the sovereignty of Russia or to the preferences of the
        populations with whose fortunes it dealt, but meant, in a word, that the
        Central Empires were to keep every foot of territory their armed forces
        had occupied every province, every city, every point of vantage as a
        permanent addition to their territories and their power. It is a
        reasonable conjecture that the general principles of settlement which
        they at first suggested originated with the more liberal statesmen of
        Germany and Austria, the men who have begun to feel the force of their
        own peoples thought and purpose, while the concrete terms of actual
        settlement came from the military leaders who have no thought but to
        keep what they have got. The negotiations have been broken off. The
        Russian representatives were sincere and in earnest. They cannot
        entertain such proposals of conquest and domination. The whole incident
        is full of significance. It is also full of perplexity. With whom are
        the Russian representatives dealing? For whom are the representatives of
        the Central Empires speaking? Are they speaking for the majorities of
        their respective parliaments or for the minority parties, that military
        and imperialistic minority which has so far dominated their whole policy
        and controlled the affairs of Turkey and of the Balkan States which have
        felt obliged to become their associates in this war?
