        Europe's new data protection rules will be a reality tomorrow.
        Europeans' privacy will be better protected and companies benefit from a
        single set of rules across the EU. Strong data protection ruels are the
        basis from a functioning Digital Single Market and for the online
        economy to prosper. The new rules ensure that citizens can trust in how
        their data is used and that the EU can make best of the opportunities of
        the data economy. Our new data protection rules were agreed for a
        reason. Two-thirds of Europeans are concerned about the way their data
        was being handled, feeling they have no control over informations they
        give online. Companies needd clarity to be able to safely extend
        operations across the EU. recent data scandals confirmed that with
        stricter and clearer data protection rules we are doing the right thing
        in Europe.
